This is one of parts for price prediction system on jarvis.ua 

Sample data is time series of prices and quantities of 1 product being sold every day for last 2 years.  
Idea is to explore component of seasonability via Discrete Fourier Transform. I suspect influence of sesonability on period of 1 week and 1 year. I'm also just learning and we barely covered FT in Uni :)
